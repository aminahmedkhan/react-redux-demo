FAILING TESTS:

Profile Reducer
should load profiles when passed LOAD_PROFILES_SUCCESS
(correctled initial state in the test to match initial state of the application
(include error and isRequesting into profiles) AND handled loadProfilesSucess
in reducer to load all the profiles from action in state also created constant
type in constants folder)

should add profile when passed CREATE_PROFILE_SUCCESS
(corrected initital state as above, and createProfileSucess is handled in
reducer also created constant type in constants folder)

should update profile when passed UPDATE_PROFILE_SUCCESS
corrected initital state as above, and handled updating profile in reducer also
created constant type in constants folder)

Async Actions
should create BEGIN_AJAX_CALL and LOAD_PROFILES_SUCCESS when loading profiles
(This test is falsely written because loadProfile() does not return a promise)

Store
should handle creating profiles
(Handled createProfileSuccess in profileReducer to add newly created profile in
profile state)
